# Goal
The goal of this book is to compile how all the mathematical formulas have
been discovered.

# Problems solve
* To avoid the mathematics becoming a dogma, for that this book proves
and display how all the formulas where discovered, instead of just thinking
that they are correct.

* There is a lot of information relate to the mathematics scattered in differ-
ent websites, journals and books. This make difficult to the people that
want to learn by themselves all the mathematical formulas. To make it
more easy, we are preparing this book which will contain all the original
information that have this sources.

* Verification of information different of the classical peer review.

# Book nomenclature

* Error zone: Is where you will find all the formulas that a person find a
error.

* Before every formula will be his name and then his id present
like this (”chapter-id”.”id-chapter-formula”)

* It can have some comments that the author want to give to the
reader
  * The formula is was find in a paper cited in the reference: [”id-
reference”]

  * The formula is a definition but there is any reference: [x]

  * Is a popular formula but it doesn’ t find how was make: (x)

  * The formula was wrote less than a month: (*)

  * The formula was wrote more than a month: (+)

  * The formula is cited in the Error Zone: (-)

  * Use a formula that is not demonstrated: (?)

* The editor will write clarifications like this Note: ”text-here”

* The editor will cite a specific formula like this ”Formula” *Space
of 1 cm* (id of the formula use)
In case it have to cite more than one formula it will put first the id of the
formula that was use in the further to the left of the formula
